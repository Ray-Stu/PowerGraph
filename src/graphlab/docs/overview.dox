  The GraphLab project started in 2009 to develop a new parallel
  computation abstraction tailored to machine learning. GraphLab 1.0
  represents our first shared memoy design which, through the addition
  of several matrix factorization toolkits, started to grow a community of users.

  In the last couple of years, we have focused our development effort
  on the distributed environment. Unfortunately, it took nearly a year
  to figure out that distributing the GraphLab 1 abstraction was
  excessively complicated and is unable to scale up to power-law
  graphs commonly seen in the real world.

  In GraphLab 2.1, we completely redesign of the GraphLab 1 framework
  for the distributed environment. The implementation is distributed
  by design and a "shared-memory" execution is essentially running a
  distributed system on a cluster of 1 machine. 
  
  And in this new release of GraphLab 2.2, we introduce the new \ref warp
  which through the use of fine-grained user-mode threading, introduces a new
  API which brings about a major increase in useability, and will allow us to 
  provide new capabilities more easily in the future.

  There are two starting points where one may begin using GraphLab.  \li \ref
  toolkits "Toolkits" You can lookup the toolkit documentation here if you have
  a computation task which is already implemented by one of our toolkits.  \li
  \ref using_graphlab "GraphLab C++ Tutorial" If you have a computation task
  which is not implemented by our toolkits, you could try implementing
  yourself! For now a certain degree of C++ knowledge is required. 

  The new GraphLab 2.2 \ref warp is available for experimentation. A
  \ref using_warp tutorial is provided, and we are are looking for feedback 
  to continue extending and improving the Warp system. Performance tuning is 
  also underway.
