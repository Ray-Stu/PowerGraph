\section toolkit_matrix_factorization_intro Introduction

The GraphLab Matrix Factorization toolkit can be used for a wide range
of applications in collaborative filtering and recommendation
systems. Matrix factorization can be cast as a graph processing by
interpreting the typically sparse matrix as a graph and then treating
the vertices as rows and columns.  

In this library we have implemented the following initial algorithms:

\li Alternating Least Squares \ref als.cpp
\li Positive Singular Value Decomposition \ref svd.cpp


\todo Finish documenting the Matrix factorization toolkit description.
