\page toolkits GraphLab Toolkits


To enable users to use GraphLab out-of-the-box and to demonstrate the
power of the GraphLab API we have implemented a collection of
applications to address a wide range of standard tasks in large-scale
graph computation.  

We have implemented the following toolkits

\li \subpage topic_modeling  contains applications like LDA which can be
used to cluster documents and extract topical representations.

\li \subpage graph_algorithms contains algorithms mostly from the Social Network Analysis Handbook algorithms set.

\li \subpage graph_analytics contains application like pagerank and
triangle counting which can be applied to general graphs to estimate
community structure.

\li \subpage clustering contains standard data clustering tools such as 
Kmeans

\li \subpage collaborative_filtering contains a collection of
applications used to make predictions about users interests and
factorize large matrices.

\li \subpage graphical_models contains tools for making joint predictions
about collections of related random variables.

\li \subpage factor_graphs contains Belief Propagation impelementation for
factor graphs

\li \subpage linear_solvers contains solvers for linear systems of equations - currently the Jacobi algorithm is implemented

\li \subpage computer_vision contains a collection of tools for
reasoning about images.
