============
Introduction
============

GraphLab PowerGraph is a graph-based, high performance, distributed computation framework
written in C++.  

GraphLab Features:

Unified multicore/
distributed API:       write once run anywhere 

Tuned for performance: optimized C++ execution engine leverages extensive 
                       multi-threading and asynchronous IO 

Scalable:              Run on large cluster deployments by
                       intelligently placing data and computation 

HDFS Integration:      Access your data directly from HDFS 

Powerful Machine 
Learning Toolkits:     Tackle challenging machine 
                       learning problems with ease


========
Mac OS X
========
The Mac OS X build is restricted and is compiled without HDFS support, nor
distributed capabilities. All toolkits therefore run entirely on one machine
in shared memory.

These binaries have been tested to run on OS X 10.6 or greater. Though they
may work on 10.5 as well.

=====
Linux
=====
The Linux builds are more complex due to varying glibc versions as well as the
need to support both OpenMPI and MPICH2. FOUR binary releases are provided
Please obtain the package closest matching your needs. In particular, it is
important to match the MPI library you have on your cluster: 
they are not compatible.

The binary packages are:
 - graphlab_openmpi : Supports OpenMPI 1.3 and 1.4. Supports HDFS and thus
                      requires a working JVM (whether or not you use 
                      HDFS).
 - graphlab_mpich2 : Supports MPICH2. Supports HDFS and thus
                     requires a working JVM (whether or not you use 
                     HDFS).
 - graphlab_openmpi_no_jvm : Supports OpenMPI 1.3 and 1.4. Does not support
                             HDFS. Does not require a working JVM. Loading
                             files distributed will therefore require either
                             a distributed file system or a common NFS
                             share.
 - graphlab_mpich2_no_jvm : Supports MPICH2. Does not support HDFS. Does not 
                            require a working JVM. Loading files distributed 
                            will therefore require either a distributed file 
                            system or a common NFS share. If you want to run
                            to run only in shared memory, this is also the
                            package to use.

Each binary is paired with a matching shell script which sets up the
execution environment (by forcing the load of provided versions of system
binaries). Several environment variables are used to control the process. 

  JAVA_HOME
     Either JAVA_HOME or JVM_SO_PATH must be set. 
     This must point to the Java home directory.
     For instance: /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk
     This was tested with Oracle's implementation of Java (sun-jdk or open-jdk).

  JVM_SO_PATH
     Either JAVA_HOME or JVM_SO_PATH must be set. 
     Optional. The script will expect to find libjvm.so in 
     $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/amd64/client/libjvm.so or
     $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so
     If libjvm.so is not in either locations, the script will fail. In which 
     case, you should set this variable to the directory containing libjvm.so.

  USE_SYSTEM_LIBS
     Optional. If set, the system's glibc (and other system dependencies) 
     will be used instead of the provided versions. 


HDFS Capability is compiled in. If HDFS is to be used, the 
"hadoop" command must be available.


Additional Notes for OpenMPI
----------------------------
Unlike the MPICH2 build, the OpenMPI build is unable to static link
everything.  For now, we provide only binary releases built against 
OpenMPI 1.3.2 which should be binary compatible with 1.4.
